# Drupal-Custom-Code-Generator
An example of a custom code generator for Drupal.

Note: There are two versions of the file corresponding to different versions of Drush. Between 11x and 12x Some changes to
the code generator meant that the generator files had to be built differently. Here are the readmes for the two versions:
- [Drush 12x code generator](https://github.com/drush-ops/drush/blob/12.x/docs/generators.md)
- [Drush 11x code generator](https://github.com/drush-ops/drush/blob/11.x/docs/generators.md)
